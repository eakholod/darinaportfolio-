      <p class="about-details">
        A native of Russia, Darya Tolok, began studying violin at the age of 5
        and a few years later moved to the USA. She earned her Bachelor’s Degree
        in Violin Performance at Sacramento State School of Music, CSU of
        Sacramento. Under the tutelage of Moni Simeonov, with full scholarship,
        she earned her Master’s Degree in Violin Performance at Bob Cole
        Conservatory of Music, CSU of Long Beach. Darya studied with multiple
        teachers from Russia and the US, some of which were Anna Presler, Igor
        Veligan and Moni Simeonov.

      <p class="about-details">
        During 18 years of playing, Darya gained valuable experience in teaching
        and performing. Darya played in local symphony orchestras in Southern
        and Northern California, including Sacramento Philharmonic and Opera,
        Huntington Beach Symphony Orchestra, jazz bands, chamber groups, and
        church orchestras. She served as concertmaster at the Bob Cole
        Conservatory of Music while pursuing her Master’s Degree, and coached
        multiple high school orchestras, while privately teaching violin, viola,
        and music theory. In her undergraduate studies, Darya served as a music
        theory tutor, and while in her graduate studies she was the student
        assistant of the BCCM symphony orchestra conductor and the chair of
        string studies. As a student, she performed at master classes for Carl
        Wiersma, Midori Goto, Benjamin Sung, Domenic Salerni and Solomiya
        Ivakhiv.
      </p>
      <p class="about-details">
        For over five years Darya has been teaching violin, viola and music
        theory to children of ages 5 and up privately, in music schools and high
        schools. Every year she teaches, inspires, and gives talks at strings’
        summer festivals. Darya also enjoys playing violin and viola in
        orchestras, chamber groups, and wedding ensembles throughout northern
        and southern California. Based in Sacramento, Darya’s goal as a teacher
        is to motivate her students to explore, enjoy, and share music with
        others, as well as develop their own learning skills and critical
        thinking.
